              Hello, my name is Fadhil, and I’m a passionate software developer
              with a knack for creating intuitive and user-friendly
              applications. <br /> <br />
              With hands-on experience in both iOS and multi-platform
              development, I have successfully built innovative solutions that
              cater to diverse user needs. <br /> <br />
              In my portfolio, you’ll find projects like FavFood’s, an iOS app
              that simplifies food ordering with its seamless browsing and
              customization features, and Sarang Dating App, a platform designed
              to foster meaningful connections through secure chatting and
              advanced matchmaking. I’m also proud to have contributed to
              KampusGratis, Indonesia's first free higher education platform,
              which promotes accessible e-learning for everyone, and Find House
              App, a hassle-free solution for finding affordable living spaces
              based on location, price, and amenities. <br /> <br />
              My technical expertise spans a range of tools and technologies,
              including JavaScript, Swift, HTML & CSS, TailwindCSS, and ReactJS,
              complemented by a strong foundation in UI Design (Figma). Beyond
              technical skills, I value problem-solving, creativity, and
              effective communication, which allow me to thrive in collaborative
              environments and deliver impactful results. <br /> <br />
              Fluent in Indonesian and proficient in English, I’m always eager
              to learn, innovate, and bring ideas to life through technology.
              Let’s create something extraordinary together! <br /> <br />
